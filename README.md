Add the following:


implement a "save and print" feature
[you implemented ‘print’ in Sprint 3]

"save" will create a file on storage that contains a record with a time stamp (date and time), the weight of the shim bundle, and the count of number of shims


validate the undo feature

either allow multiple “undos” [harder]

or only allow one [undo] and not multiple [undo] commands in sequence
either “gray out” [undo] or alert the user that [undo] can’t be pressed twice if they do so



Provide good information in the help menu



Ensure the program meets the user’s needs and functions correctly. Give careful thought to the user experience in addition to the coding. The code should be developed following “professional programming practice” (readable, meaningful, etc).# Shim-Bundle-App
